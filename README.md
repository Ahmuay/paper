## Rationale behind the name Greenpaper

> Vitalik Buterin started with the white paper, then Dr. Gavin Wood wrote the yellow paper, and has now written a polkadot paper. [..] It follows the same pattern as the Tour De France’s winners jerseys. The TDF has four jerseys awarded to riders who win certain classifications - white (best young rider), yellow (overall race leader), polkadot (king of the mountains), and green (points leader - best sprinter). Given the close relationship between Ethereum, Polkadot, and Melon, it’s an interesting pattern that ties all four of the paper’s together. - Conor Svensson
